<blockquote>
  "We were made for community &ndash; deep in our human DNA is a hunger for relationship.  The God who created us is a relational God &ndash; Father, Son and Spirit &ndash; and God longs for us to experience authentic human community that has its source in God's life. That's why Jesus created a community of disciples.   And that's what our LinkGroups are all about.  At Lincoln Road we want everyone who worships with us to experience a sense of belonging and being connected and encouraged in life.  I hope you will get involved.  I know you'll have fun, learn together and grow closer to God."

<p>LinkGroups are groups of 4-12 people who meet regularly outside of church to support and encourage each other, to grow spiritually by exploring scripture and praying together and sometimes working together in service projects.  They're a wonderful way to become an integral part of Lincoln Road Chapel and the community.</p>

    <li>Gain insight into the meaning of the Bible</li>
