        "We were made for community &ndash; deep in our human DNA is a hunger for relationship.  The God who created us is a relational God &ndash; Father, Son and Spirit &ndash; and God longs for us to experience authentic human community that has its source in God's life. That's why Jesus created a community of disciples.   And that's what our LinkGroups are all about.  At Lincoln Road we want everyone who worships with us to experience a sense of belonging and being connected and encouraged in life.  I hope you will get involved.  I know you'll have fun, learn together and grow closer to God."
