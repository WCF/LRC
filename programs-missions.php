    "Central Asia is about as far from Lincoln Road Chapel as you can possibly get. But as I serve among students there, I have a sense that God is working through the church community in Waterloo to extend his reach to the ends of the earth!"

    Missions at Lincoln Road Chapel is all about extending the Kingdom of God beyond our borders.  We cultivate, prepare and support people to extend the kingdom in spheres beyond our city, region and natural environments. It is our desire to see the Lord's Prayer fulfilled not only in our city and region but all over the world. Jesus taught us to pray, "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."  Matthew 5:9, 10.   We believe it is the will of the Father that mercy, salvation and justice be extended everywhere and that all should have the privilege of knowing Jesus as Saviour and Lord.  Therefore we will seek to inspire our congregation about global needs, respond to humanitarian crisis and support members who are called to extend the kingdom in other parts of the world.
