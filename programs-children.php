        Did you know that the set of beliefs a person holds when they are
        13 years old is often what they will die believing? (George Barna).
        This means that ministering to our children is vital! Among all the
        Bible stories, memory verses, songs and activities that go into
        children’s ministry, it is important that when children graduate
        from our ministry they haven’t missed Jesus at the center of it
        all. Therefore our main priority is introducing kids to Jesus and
        our prayer and desire is that their hearts are captured by God’s
        love and grace demonstrated at the cross. Further, we desire that
        kids would learn how to be close followers of Jesus and grow into
        mature, multiplying disciples"

        <i>Linkin’ Kids</i>
        is the children’s ministry of Lincoln Road Chapel. The goal of Linkin’
        Kids is to connect the children of Lincoln Road Chapel to God and to
        their peers and adults in the family of God. We aim to be
        Christ-centered in all we do, teach the Bible faithfully and
        creatively, foster growing relationships, encourage Holy Spirit
        transformation and mobilize children to serve
        .
    </p>

    <p>
        The main programming is on Sunday mornings but there are also special
        events monthly and seasonal programs. Linkin’ Kids includes
        <a href="/index.php?pr=Nursery">
            nursery
        </a>
        (0-23 months),
        <a href="/index.php?pr=Preschool">
            preschool
        </a>
        (2 year olds ~ SK), and
        <a href="/index.php?pr=Elementary">
            elementary (grade 1 ~ 5) students.
    </p>

    <p>
        Seasonal events are provided to give children and parents an
        opportunity to connect outside of the Sunday service. Events  we have
        done in the past include Amazing Race Family Edition, Banana Day,
        Family Winter Celebration, and a Carnival. A week-long Vacation Bible
        School program is also offered in August for children from Lincoln Road
        Chapel and the community.  For a list of upcoming events, visit our
        <a href="/index.php?pr=Upcoming_Events">Upcoming Events</a>
        page.
    </p>

    <p>
        All volunteers in Linkin’ Kids programs are screened through an
        application, police checks, and reference checks with Nicole, our
        Volunteer Security Coordinator:
        <a href="mailto:nicole[at]lincolnroadchapel[dot]ca">nicole[at]lincolnroadchapel[dot]ca</a>
        . Volunteers are equipped and trained to properly care for children and
        shepherd them in their walk with God. We currently have need for
        volunteers in many areas of Children's ministry.
    </p>
