    <blockquote>
        Did you know that the set of beliefs a person holds when they are 13 years old is often what they will die
        believing?  (George Barna).  This means that ministering to our children is vital! Among all the Bible stories,
        memory verses, songs and activities that go into children's ministry, it is important that when children graduate
        from our ministry they haven't missed Jesus at the center of it all.  Therefore our main priority is introducing
        kids to Jesus and our prayer and desire is that their hearts are captured by God's love and grace demonstrated at
        the cross. Further, we desire that kids would learn how to be close followers of Jesus and grow into mature,
        multiplying disciples.

        <i>Linkin' Kids</i> is the children's ministry of Lincoln Road Chapel. The goal of Linkin' Kids is to connect the
        children of Lincoln Road Chapel to God and to their peers and adults in the family of God. We aim to be
        Christ-centered in all we do, teach the Bible faithfully and creatively, foster growing relationships, encourage
        Holy Spirit transformation and mobilize children to serve.
