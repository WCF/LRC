    <h2>About our Logo</h2>

    <p>
    Different people see different things when they look at the logo. Some people see a flame. Great! The flame speaks of fire and heat. The flame reminds us of Moses' burning bush experience and how God calls individuals into a relationship with Him. In the New Testament, the flame is symbolic of God's Holy Spirit and how God infuses people with supernatural power. And the flame speaks of the heart, the very centre of life and the spiritual essence of faith.

    Others see a pair of hands. Hands are used to greet others. Hands are the symbol of help. Hands are the practical extension of how we feel about others. In fact, it's only when our love is expressed in practical ways that people know our care is genuine. For many people, it's tangible care from Christians that introduces them to the love that God has for them.

    Others note that one hand reaches down and the other reaches up. God Himself reaches down to invite each human being into an eternal relationship with Him. He reached down to deliver His Son to a death He didn't deserve to pay a debt He didn't owe, so that we could have access to eternal life as followers of Jesus. And it represents the generous hand of God which pours blessings into our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
    And the hand reaching up? It portrays the need we have for what God has to offer: love, forgiveness, compassion, peace, just to name few. As we reach up, He meets us at the point of our need. That hand also symbolizes our imploring God for our needs and the needs of others.
    </p>
    <p>
    But there's more to the hand reaching up than just receiving. It's a giving hand, too. We give our thanks and praise, we give our worship to God. And we give ourselves and our service in gratitude for what He has so graciously given us.
