    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
    We're so glad you clicked on Lincoln Road Chapel. We want it to be known as a place where YOU matter and Jesus is the main attraction - because we're all about relationships. We're keen on reaching out to and serving the community around us through our basketball and summer camps, through a 12-step program called <a href="programs-celebrate-recovery.php">Celebrate Recovery</a>, through a parenting program for immigrant families, and much more. And, we're keen on developing a sense of community within the church through our small group ministries. We have small groups meeting all over KW most every evening on a variety of topics and needs. We want people to connect with each other and with God in ways that enrich their lives.

    We're a diverse bunch of Christ-followers who share our building with the Conestoga College Linc program (English as a second language), and have a large immigrant population representing Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. We have strong programs for children and teens and members of our congregation provide leadership for three different campus ministries at Laurier and University of Waterloo. This is a good place for students.

    Our values include a strong commitment to caring for children and families, to caring for hurting people here and away, to serving creatively and to providing opportunities for people to grow spiritually through serving others. So, whether you need to be served or whether you are ready to serve, we've got a spot for you.

    People tell us they find this church warm and welcoming. "As soon as we walked through the door, we knew this was the church for us," is something we hear often. We hope you'll check us out by browsing through our website and discovering the range of ministries available. And we'd love to have you check us out by making a visit. Even if you don't decide to make Lincoln your home church, the visit won't be wasted - you will have met people who could become life-long friends and you'll have enjoyed a Sunday service that inspires without giving pat answers, that stretches the mind and builds confidence in God's Word, and music that gives voice to the worshiping heart.

    Our main services are at 9:00 am and 11:00 am Sunday mornings, but we've got lots happening throughout the week as well. Our Mandarin Congregation meets upstairs every Sunday at 11:00 am. C'mon by! We'd love to meet you and share this exciting journey of life together.
