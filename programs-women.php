        "Women's Ministry is a sisterhood! I have made so many friends, from all ages and walks of life. When I have a question about a season in my life I know there is someone who I can talk to who will bring the elements of Christ with her and I hope I do the same for others too. As sisters we pray together, play together, laugh together and learn together. I would really miss not being a part of the Women's Ministry."

    Women's Programs at Lincoln Road Chapel provide opportunities for women to grow in their personal faith and knowledge of the Lord, share their faith and connect and encourage one another in all that life holds.  We know that women today have varying needs and preferences. Their circumstances and seasons of life are diverse as well! In light of these things, we have a variety of programs available. Women are free to participate in all or some of the activities, depending on their lifestyle and season of life.
    </p><p>
    Women are facing challenges unique to this generation and time in history. It's our desire and goal to understand these challenges and provide creative, time-efficient and real-life opportunities for encouragement and growth. It's our prayer that we can have long arms and big hearts to reach out beyond ourselves - sharing these opportunities with many other women...women new to the community and women new to the country. So, we welcome you...hopefully beyond this web page and into a place of belonging here at Lincoln Road Chapel.

    <h3>Events</h3>

    <h4>Connections</h4>
    <p>
    A very special part of Women's Ministries is Connections - a ministry designed to meet the unique needs of  single women. Developing friendships that are non-judgemental and supportive is a key component for healing from and coping with the particular issues of life as single women. Once a month  we meet at the chapel for a pot-luck supper, fellowship and fun as well as encouragement through special speakers and/or topics. The last Sunday of every month, Serenity Lunches are held in homes after Sunday morning services. Everyone brings their own bag lunch! There are other informal gatherings as well.

    <h4>Mug &amp; Muffin</h4>
    <p>
    Several times a year, on a Saturday morning for a quick hour, we gather at the cafe for a cup of coffee, a muffin and to listen to one of our ladies share their faith journey. You bring your own mug and hopefully a friend and we will supply the muffins! It's an informal and warm setting - an opportunity to get to know one another and be encouraged.
