    As believers, prayer is the most powerful tool we have to communicate with God. The prayer chain exists as a way for members of Lincoln Road Chapel to communicate emergency prayer requests. The prayer chain allows us to partner with one another and God to carry each others burdens. We pray for God's will to be done in difficult and trying situations.

    <h4>LinkGroups</h4>
    <p>
    <a href="programs-link-groups.php">LinkGroups</a> are wonderful way to be prayed for and to pray for others.  In a LinkGroup, you meet with the same individuals on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, studying the Bible, sharing with and praying for one another.  To find out more information about LinkGroups, visit our LinkGroups page.

    <h4>Prayer Chain</h4>

    Lincoln Road Chapel has a Prayer Chain designated for emergency prayer items.  If you have an item you need prayer for immediately contact the church office.
