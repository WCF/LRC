            "It's a real privilege to serve as Coordinator of the WPT. I love
            exercising my God given gifts in this capacity and I love to assist
            others to achieve excellence in serving God in their part of
            Ministry at LRC - in particular on Sunday mornings. I would like
            to see the Sunday morning services at LRC become a highlight in our
            weekly experience. I fervently believe that the God I serve and
            love is a God who cares about the details... just take a look at
            the
            wings of a butterfly. It's very exciting to think that helping to
            keep the details of Sunday mornings straight is part of His great
            plan for LRC."<br><br>

    <h3>Worship Planning Team (WPT)</h3>

    The WPT is comprised of three to four people from both congregations and
    also a member of the Leadership Team. Tiffany Svensson-Knight is currently
    serving as WPT Coordinator and the other team members currently include:
    Heidi Mikitka, and David Knight from the Leadership Team. The Worship
    Leaders and Speakers for the Sundays being planned are also invited to
    these planning meetings. Every two weeks, the team meets to plan two to
    three services and also evaluate the success of the previous two services.
    We consider a service to be a success if one or more of the following
    happens:
    <ul>
        <li>God is glorified and worshiped</li>
        <li>The work of Jesus Christ is proclaimed</li>
        <li>People feel renewed in their spirit and inspired to follow Jesus
            more unreservedly
        </li>
        <li>People look forward to coming back</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    We invite you to share how the Sunday service has touched you or how you
    think it could have been more effective. To offer your feedback, complete
    our Online Worship Service Feedback Form . Our prayer is that through
    thoughtful consideration of the curriculum and creative input from the
    participants our planning meetings will allow each member of the two
    congregations to experience a powerful life-changing encounter with God
    each week.
