        The Young Adult Ministry at Lincoln Road Chapel seems to be always changing
        and just getting better! On Sunday evenings (September-April), we meet in
        the cafe for small groups, worship nights and to serve in the community. In
        the summer, we have a get together on the last Sunday of the month. If you
        are in college or university, working after highschool or taking some time
        to find out what life is all about, we'd love to have you become a part of
        the crew!
